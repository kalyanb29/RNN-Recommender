The following files were automatically generated by preprocess.py
	user_id_mapping
		mapping between the users ids in the original dataset and the new users ids.
		the first column contains the new id and the second the original id.
		Inactive users might have been deleted from the original, and they will therefore not appear in the id mapping.
	item_id_mapping
		Idem for item ids.
	train_set_triplets
		Training set in the triplets format.
		Each line is a user item interaction in the form (user_id, item_id, rating). 
		Interactions are listed in chronological order.
	train_set_sequences
		Training set in the sequence format.
		Each line contains all the interactions of a user in the form (user_id, first_item_id, first_rating, 2nd_item_id, 2nd_rating, ...).
	train_set_sequences+
		Extended training set in the sequence format.
		The extended training set contains all the training set plus the first half of the interactions of each users in the validation and testing set.
	val_set_triplets
		Validation set in the triplets format
	val_set_sequences
		Validation set in the sequence format
	test_set_triplets
		Test set in the triplets format
	test_set_sequences
		Test set in the sequence format
	stats
		Contains some informations about the dataset.
	The training, validation and test sets are obtain by randomly partitioning the users and all their interactions into 3 sets.
	The validation set contains 500 users, the test_set 500 users and the train set all the other users.
